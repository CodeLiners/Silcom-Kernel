# Silcom Kernel

## What is Silcom?

[Silcom][Silcom] is a [ComputerCraft][CC] custom Operating System. This is the latest rewrite. At this point it is FAR away from being stable since not even the Kernel is ready for productive use. You should not download it unless you either plan on helping us or are really hardcore.

## How can I use this Kernel in my OS?

You're probably best off forking this Repository and adding your own Modules to the Kernel, then you can create a Git Submodule in your local OS Repository pointing to the Kernel Repository (you can also skip the forking part and just point the Submodule to this Repository).
